/*
we are looking for minimum k
if k is too small, total hours taken > h
if k is too big, total hours taken < h

we are looking for the k where hours taken == h

we are told that h >= piles.length. It must be, because if h < piles.length even with k set to infinity koko could never get through all the piles because she is limited to one pile per hour

if h > piles.length it doesn't matter for minimising k. If we minimise k at h == piles.length then that k will still be the minimum at any h > piles.length

minimum possible k: 1 -> if 0 then total hours taken is infinite
maximum possible k: maxOf(piles) -> would mean total hours taken == h. Anything beyond maxOf(piles) would lead to the same total hours taken

so find minimum k in range 1..maxOf(piles)
